1. Real-Time Data Tracking
The primary function is to provide live price updates for various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). It includes metrics such as:

Price: Current market value in fiat (e.g., USD, KRW).

24h Change: Percentage increase or decrease over the last day.

Market Cap: The total value of all coins in circulation.

2. Technical Analysis & Charts
Professional crypto pages integrate advanced charting tools (like TradingView). These allow users to view price movements over different timeframes (1m, 1h, 1D) and apply technical indicators like RSI or Moving Averages to predict market trends.

3. Order Book & Market Depth
A crypto page displays the Order Book, showing live "Buy" (Bid) and "Sell" (Ask) orders. This helps traders understand liquidity and the immediate supply and demand at specific price levels.

4. Wallet & Asset Management
Users can view their personal holdings, including:

Balance: Total available funds (Seed money).

Portfolio Distribution: A breakdown of which coins they own.

Transaction History: A record of past trades and transfers.

5. Trading Terminal
This is the execution hub where users place orders.

Manual Trade: Users set their own price and quantity.

AI/Automated Trading: Advanced pages use bots or AI engines to execute trades based on pre-set algorithms and market signals.

6. AI Analysis & Logs
Modern crypto pages often include an AI Briefing section. This provides automated summaries of market conditions, sentiment analysis, and real-time logs of automated trading performance (Profit/Loss).
